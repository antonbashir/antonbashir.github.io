Many years ago, I had the chance to meet an extraordinary professor who planted something in my mind that I call the "modelling core"—a skill capable of managing systems, objects, concepts, and phenomena.  

Modelling is carried out according to certain principles. These principles are as follows:  

1. **Principle of Integrity** – Applied when only a part of an object is subject to modelling, determined by the goals and objectives of the modeling. A system's integrity is characterized by the interrelation and interaction of its elements. These interrelations can be structural or functional.  
2. **Principle of Systemicity** – The study of the original object and the creation of its model must account for the ability of its components to enter into relationships, resulting in emergent properties of the system (model), including those not inherent in any individual component.  
3. **Principle of Complexity** – The model considers the degree of participation of each system component at the level of its properties as determined by the goals of the modelling. Thus, heterogeneous properties of a complex object are reflected in their interaction and interrelation, ensuring model adequacy in line with the modeling objective.  
4. **Principle of Informational Sufficiency** – With no information about an object, constructing its model is impossible. If information is complete, modeling becomes pointless. There exists a critical threshold of prior knowledge about an object beyond which an adequate model can be built.  
5. **Principle of Modularity** – Purposeful, integral systems should consist of components (modules) whose internal properties significantly outweigh external ones. This ensures internal stability and relative independence of modules from each other and the environment, with each module oriented toward performing a single function.  
6. **Principle of Coherence** – In an integral system, each component is interconnected and interacts with every other in such a way that a necessary and sufficient change in one induces corresponding proportional changes in the others and in the system as a whole.  
7. **Principle of the Leading Component** – Depending on the operating mode, certain components in a system may be the most active and exert the greatest influence on others, determining the behavior of the entire system.  
8. **Principle of Introspection** – During modeling and description of an object, its internal structure and behavior are analyzed in accordance with the goals of the modelling. This principle determines the level of detail and representation of the object in the model.  
9. **Principle of Extrospection** – Involves external analysis of the modeled object, considering it as a whole and its interaction with the environment. This helps define the object's boundaries and account for external influences (e.g., setting initial and boundary conditions).  
10. **Principle of Correspondence** – The model should reflect the original at a given level of detail, as determined by the modeling goals. At the same time, the model should be simpler than the original.  
11. **Principle of Minimal Construction** – The model should consist of the smallest necessary number of components, optimally (materially, energetically, and informationally) aligned with the modeling objective.  
12. **Principle of Autocatalysis** – In systems composed of many homogeneous, orderly connected components, the presence of a certain property in one part increases the likelihood of its appearance in others. Without this property, the system becomes unstable.  
13. **Principle of Maximum Simplification** – The model should account only for the most essential properties of the object relevant to the modeling goals, while ignoring secondary ones.  
14. **Principle of Adequacy** – The model must maintain an adequate relationship with the original, ensuring not only qualitative similarity but also structural and functional proximity in line with the modeling objectives.  
15. **Principle of Conceptualization** – Modeled objects should be represented as concepts forming conceptual systems, serving as ideal reflections of the original in the model in the form of informational portraits.  
16. **Principle of Feasibility** – The model must ensure the goal is achievable with a non-zero probability within a finite time (threshold values for probability *P* and time *t* are set).  
17. **Principle of Multiplicity** – The model should interpret information about the original in its own terms. A comprehensive study of an object requires a set of models reflecting its properties at varying levels of detail.  
18. **Principle of Informational Transparency** – The model should allow monitoring, modifying, and recording data at key nodes (transparency zones) as defined by the modeling objectives.  
19. **Principle of Informativeness** – The model is built on the most important and relevant information presented in the required form. It serves as a data repository in a strictly defined format for generating new information.  
20. **Principle of Development** – First, a simple model reflecting the key properties of the object is created, then additional details are gradually incorporated until the desired result is achieved.  
21. **Principle of Complexity Reduction** – When creating a model, Pareto’s Law (80/20 rule) is considered: 20% of the most significant components determine 80% of the system's properties, while the remaining 80% account for only 20%. Effective analysis increases the likelihood of model correctness.  
22. **Principle of Controllability** – Changes in the model should steer it toward the modeling goal, even under changing external conditions.  
23. **Principle of Purposefulness** – The model's functioning should lead to the desired result with a specified accuracy.  
24. **Principle of Aggregation** – Complex systems can be represented as subsystems. This allows the use of standard mathematical frameworks and flexible model adjustments based on research goals.  
25. **Principle of Parametrization** – If a system contains relatively isolated subsystems characterized by a specific parameter, they can be replaced by numerical values, tables, graphs, or analytical expressions.
